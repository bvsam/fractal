## Building

### Locally

Note: Building the code locally requires [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) to be installed.

To build and run the code, do the following:

1. Make a `build` directory and cd into it

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
```

2. While in the `build` directory, run `cmake` with the `CMakeLists.txt` in the root directory of this repo.

```bash
cmake ..
```

3. Run make

```bash
make
```

4. Run the generated binary

```
./fractal
```
